At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (57,57.0,57) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 78.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.8,11) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,32.3,37) frames.
Overall, cl accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,5.0,4) frames.
Overall, hh accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,9.0,7) frames.
Overall, t accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,5.5,4) frames.
Overall, ax accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, en accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,16.0,16) frames.
Overall, ix accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, iy accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, l accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 56.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 65.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 33.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 8.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,37.0,3)
